# Dartmouth-Pathfinder

The goal of this project is to design a mini “Google Maps” for Dartmouth campus locations by creating a graph that models part of the campus, finding the shortest path from one vertex to another using breadth-first search, and visualizing the path on the map.


## Usage
1. Run `map_plot.py`
2. Press your mouse on one of the blue vertices and release it when the color of the vertex changes to red.
3. With the mouse button not pressed, move the mouse over to another vertex of your choice.

The program will perform a breadth-first search on the graph and draw the resulting connecting path in red on the graph. The program will also display the names of the starting and ending vertices.


This project was done as an assignment for Dartmouth’s Computer Science course. If you are a professor teaching this course and would like me to make the repository private, please reach out to me [here](mailto:aimen.a.abdulaziz.25@dartmouth.edu). Thanks!
